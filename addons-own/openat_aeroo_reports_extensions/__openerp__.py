    "version" : "1.2",

This Module adds the possibility to add optional Products, Headers and Subtotals to Sales Orders and Invoices.

New Functions for Sales-Order-Lines
========================================
* Hide the price on the report-line -> H
* Exclude from Subtotal -> ES
* Exclude from Grand-Total of the sales Order -> ET
* Add a Product called SUBTOTAL and you will get a Subtotal on the report (from this line to the last Subtotal)
* Add a Product called SUBTOTAL-ALL and you will get a Subtotal including all lines on the report
* Add a Product called HEADER and this will be printed as a Header on the report.

New Functions for Sales-Orders and Invoices
========================================
* Include Image: The Product Images will be printed Reports
* Include Description: The Long Description of Products will be printed on Reports

If you confirm a Sales Order no SO-Line with "Exclude from Grand-Total" is allowed since this would make no
sence for the generated Invoices.

ATTENTION: You will have to write custom aeroo-reports for sales orders and invoices
